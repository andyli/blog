It's already the 3rd month of doing a piece of generative art everyday.
Here are some selected pieces.

Reused previous month's feather code to make a sensitive plant.

Backed to play with abstract geometry. I like its sketch style wooden
texture.

Following one gives some nice harmonic color.

Replacing lines with circles, it's now more saturated.

Since Martin Lindel√∂f made available its [clothx][] physics lib, which
is based on [traer physics][] for [Processing][], I used its
spring/attraction system to draw some stuff.  
[!["20110308_193753 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5217/5508536897_7b1120995f_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5508536897/)

It is very easy to create beautiful structures with the lib.

[!["20110311_031333 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5173/5515055085_b8701a9391_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5515055085/)

More organic one. Stroke size is proportional to particle speed.  
[!["20110313_172705 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5294/5522289682_89665f29bb_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5522289682/)

Linking up the particles.  
[!["20110314_161400 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5175/5525767896_bc905906bf_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5525767896/)

Sorting the particles before drawing in each frame.  
[!["20110315_171922 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5215/5528354133_daef9f5577_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5528354133/)

Old school generative curves. Can you hear the sound?  
[!["20110318_214522 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5177/5536822567_739cf79c0b_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5536822567/)

Smaller, moving strings.  
[!["20110321_173927 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5024/5546412590_923c312766_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5546412590/)

Fixed, more complex strings with rainbow colors.  
[!["20110322_172246 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5173/5549186237_137cf460f2_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5549186237/)

Scaling up.  
[!["20110323_173620 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5059/5552753514_5950e1b6e1_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5552753514/)

Scaling down with blood vessel colors.  
[!["20110326_001833 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5187/5558981478_4cfef78acb_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5558981478/)

Even more complex strings. Simply drawing them down but not painting
them frame-by-frame like the previous ones.  
[!["20110328_195131 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5260/5568080040_467715ffc6_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5568080040/)  
[!["20110329_232009 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5179/5571655848_3cfe3897f3_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5571655848/)  
[!["20110330_033407 by on_the_wings, on Flickr"](http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5225/5572234422_bca4c5598d_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andy-li/5572234422/)

Colored version. It looks like coral. Maybe the algorithm is similar to
coral's growth.

[Epic Win](http://www.rexbox.co.uk/epicwin/) is a game that runs in the Apple iOS platform
(iPhone/iPad). It is a fusion of role-playing game, referred as RPG, and
To-Do list application. Players define and input their own personal
objectives in real life as game objectives. Once players mark an
objective as complete, they will be moved forward in a quest map and may
discover loot of game item. Experience points, referred as XP in the
game, will also be given which will level up the player.

The game is set in a strongly naturalistic virtual world in an extreme
case that, in fact, the virtual game world is built on top of the real
world. The game objectives are objective in real life. To complete the
objective, players have to perform real life action using their own
physical body. However, the game world is not exactly the real world.
Epic Win’s game world is virtual in the sense that there are virtual
game elements like XP, treasure loots that do not exist in real world.

The simulation approach of Epic Win is different from typical simulation
games like The Sims. Because the game world of Epic Win is built on top
of the real world with added virtual elements, instead of started as a
virtual world and added real world characteristic, the simulation
direction is the opposite of typical simulation games. Epic Win uses the
real world and simulates a typical RPG world; typical simulation games
use a virtual world and simulate the real world. As Manovich suggested,
“we do not necessarily have to think of immersion in the virtual and
augmentation of the physical as
opposites” (<cite title="Manovich, Lev. &quot;The poetics of augmented space.&quot; Visual Communication (2006): 219-240.">Manovich,
The poetics of augmented space</cite>). Although the approaches are
different to each other, both outcome of Epic Win and typical simulation
games is a mixed reality.

Simulation requires modeling the logic or behavior of the simulation
target (<cite title="Manovich, Lev. &quot;The Illusions.&quot; Manovich, Lev. The Language of New Media. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2001. 162-167.">Manovich,
The Illusions</cite>). Epic Win modeled a typical medieval themed RPG
world in several ways. Firstly, it modeled the game logic, which is to
complete missions (objectives) to gain points and collect game items in
order to level up. In RPG, when the player level up, the ability of the
player will be increased. Since a game cannot directly increase the
player’s abilities in real life, Epic Win modeled this with virtual
abilities of a RPG character, eg. “strength”, “intelligent” etc.
Secondly, a typically RPG game has a story line. Epic Win simulated it
by taking the seemly non-related real life objectives, map onto a
logical narrative experience. Lastly, typical RPG uses a fantasy world.
Epic Win simulated the fantasy world by extensive use of heavily
stylized media, including wordings, graphics, and sounds, in medieval
theme. The game items contained in the loots which players collect, are
also typical object in a fantasy world.

Epic Win presents to players a hyperreality that solving real life
problems will be rewarded with XP and treasures that can enhance the
virtual character of the player. Since such world presented by Epic Win
does not really exist, it matches the definition of hyperreality, "A
real without origin or
reality" (<cite title="Baudrillard, Jean. Simulacra and Simulation. Michigan: University of Michigan Press, 1995.">Baudrillard</cite>).
This character development, i.e. level up, is one of the basic
fulfillments of playing RPG. The progress of player is simulated as an
exploration in a virtual world. It corresponds to the story-telling part
of a RPG, which can also encourage player to move forward, in terms of
completing tasks, and immerse into the virtual world, the enhanced real
world.

The process of adding playful game elements in real life activity, which
is increasing popular nowadays, is referred as gamification. It is “the
application of digital game design techniques to non-game problems, such
as business and social impact
challenges” (<cite title="Werbach, Kevin. Gamification. 2012. 29 Oct 2012 &lt;https://www.coursera.org/course/gamification&gt;.">Werbach</cite>).
I consider it as a form of mixed reality as well as a hyperreality. It
is because its aim is clearly to trick users to enjoy non-game activity
as they enjoy games, making the boundary of entertainment and work
blurry. Al Gore summed up, "Games are the new
normal." (<cite title="Tsai, Charles. Al Gore: 'Games Are the New Normal'. 22 June 2011. 30 Oct 2012 &lt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-tsai/al-gore-games-social-good_b_881017.html&gt;.">Tsai</cite>).
People will increasingly treat real life as game, and work as
entertainment. Even the military is using the same technologies and
employing the same visual
forms (<cite title="Manovich, Lev. &quot;Kino-Eye and Simulators.&quot; Manovich, Lev. The Language of New Media. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2001. 234-240.">Manovich,
Kino-Eye and Simulators</cite>). Virtual awards, game media and game
concepts are natural additions to daily life activity.

Gamification as demonstrated by Epic Win is an interesting example of
“simulation” and “hyperreality”. There were players of Epic Win observed
an uptick in their
productivity (<cite title="Rattray, Tim. EpicWin Gives You Loot For Doing Your Chores. 18 Augest 2010. 30 Oct 2012 &lt;http://www.slidetoplay.com/story/epicwin-gives-you-loot-for-doing-your-chores&gt;.">Rattray</cite>).
Further scientific measurement of the relation between productivity
improvement and game immersiveness would be useful.

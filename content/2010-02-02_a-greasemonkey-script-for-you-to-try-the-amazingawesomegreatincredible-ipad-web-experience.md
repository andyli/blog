Steve Jobs says the iPad is ["Amazing, Awesome, Beautiful, Great,
Incredible, Really Nice and Unbelievable"](http://gizmodo.com/5461445/the-apple-ipad-keynote-in-3-minutes-of-adjectives). I'm sure you wanna try it.
If you still haven't get one to experience by yourself, here I made a
little GreaseMonkey script for you to feel it first.

Once you installed the [iPad experience script][] on FireFox (or any
other browser that can use user script), you wouldn't see any Flash
elements again. No more Flash can hurt you or your children. Instead,
all the swfs are replaced with a "Amazing, Awesome, Beautiful, Great,
Incredible, Really Nice and Unbelievable" blue lego, reminding you the
glory of Apple.

Update:  
You can use it in Chrome now (if you have extension enabled)!

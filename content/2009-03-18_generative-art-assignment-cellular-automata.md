Finally I can post some recent Flash stuff I've done... So many stuffs
are not yet ready and some are just silly.

This week's Flash assignment, is to generate music with [Cellular
Automata][].

[SWF]http://blog.onthewings.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/main.swf,
800, 600[/SWF]

The seed should be comma-separated values of 0-3.

Quite a few things i want to try a long time ago have been used in this
Flash assignment: dynamic sound creation, [SoundFX][],
[Async-threading][], Vector, FP10's drawing API, FlashDevelop...

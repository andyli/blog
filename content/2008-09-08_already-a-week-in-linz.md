I have already here in Linz for a whole week and going to stay 3 more
days. I really miss HK. But I think there are so many things need to be
done when I am back...

But here are really nice work to be seen. I personally love the
installations and animations most, both the techniques and ideas are
great. We have interviewed many of the award winners and artists.
Although my English is not so well that I can not totally understand
their words, I think it is a great experience.

And here is our term's [blog][] and [album][].

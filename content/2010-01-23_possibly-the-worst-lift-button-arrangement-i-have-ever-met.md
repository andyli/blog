Here we have many lifts in Hong Kong since we have so many tall
buildings. One of the lift I am using very often is the one inside
Festival Walk(a shopping mall). Here are its buttons:

First of all, the mixed use of letters and numbers (also an icon) to
name floor is confusing. I have seen many people had difficulty finding
the right floor at first sight. If there were tens of floors which goes
from lower-ground 5 to upper-ground 25, grouping the floors with
something like "UG" and "LG" would be meaningful. But as you can see in
the photo, there are only seven floors... So actually I cannot really
tell it is some kind of grouping as the group has at most
two members only... And for "UG", I really don't know why they're not
naming the "1" and "2" with "UG" as "UG1","UG2","UG3". Or simply use
"1","2","3"? You also need to think if "LG2" or "LG1" is upper floor.

Secondly, not all Hong Kong people know "LG" and "UG" stand for
"lower-ground" and "upper-ground". I have some friends misunderstood
"UG" as underground... The users are mostly Hong Kong people which are
not having English as native language. Anyway I don't see a point why
not use "-1", "0", "1", "2"...

Lastly, the arrangement of the grid is confusing. The arrangement is
different from written English(left to right, top to bottom)
or traditional Chinese(top to bottom, right to left). See below:

Not only Festival Walk, but also City University of Hong Kong has this
arrangment:

Is that only Hong Kong has these kind of lift? If so, maybe that's
because we Hong Kong people are proud to have both Western and Chinese
culture which expressed in lift button arrangement?

Update:  
I finally have found another example of the arrangement, that is...
Japanese comic?!

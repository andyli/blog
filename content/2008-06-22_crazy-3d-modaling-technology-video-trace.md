[VideoTrace: Rapid interactive scene modelling from video][]

This is a really crazy modeling technology...  
Use a video clip that has some view points (in different angles) to an
object, trace the object with a few clicks in several frames, and you
get the 3D model (mapped with auto-generated bitmaps from the clip).

[Kinect][]([OpenNI][]) is used for motion tracking, running a program I
wrote in C++ with [openFrameworks][]. Collision and softbody simulation
is done by [Bullet][].

### Artist statement

"Between the lines/書中" is an interactive installation that visualizes
the famous Chinese proverb "書中自有黃金屋", which literally means "A
book holds a house of gold".

Viewers can go into a 3D virtual space where Chinese literature
sentences suspended all over the place. By waving and touching, the
Chinese characters will be transformed into gold. And with enough golden
characters, a house of gold will be constructed.

The Chinese sentences are extracted from The Four Books(四書), which are
the authoritative texts of Confucianism(儒家) in China written two
thousand years ago. They are displayed in both traditional Chinese
calligraphy and modern fonts, in the meaning of those classic texts are
relevant to society independent of time.

The interaction is a visual representation of the joyful and rewarding
experience of reading books. There can be multiple viewers interact with
the installation at the same time, which aligned to the fact that book
reading can be a social process, where readers can share thoughts,
recommend books to each other.

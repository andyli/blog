This piece's style is quite different from the TV series \<Stand Alone
Complex\>. The style is more serious and the CG effects are much more
amazing. Unfortunately the English words used in the film are so
difficult for me to fully understand the story...

Update:

Just found out that DreamWorks is working on "3D live-action motion
picture" of Ghost in the Shell!

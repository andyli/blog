Just a few days ago, I went to CityU's brand new Usability Testing Lab
to do usability testing for my assignment. It is located in InnoCentre
(Kowloon Tong), on the 5th floor, inside Department of Media and
Communication. I searched around InnoCentre for so long since Dr. Andy
Chun (Yup, another Andy) forgot to say which room the lab is located...

For the lab, I am a little bit disappointed, since it is actually only a
little room. But the Department of Media and Communication is great.
There are many other special rooms (or labs) for recording, broadcasting
etc. And the technician who guided me through using the equipment is
really nice.

My site has been tested two times while I also help testing another
group's web site. What we have got were some heatmaps, eye-tracking
videos, and some simple software analysis (interesting areas on pages
etc.). I think it seems to be too little data for me, but there were no
time and people left to do more testing.

Actually what I am interested is booking the lab for testing games...
There was already a XBox 360 located in the room and the technician kept
asking us to play... It will be good to let me try testing my
forthcoming games, but may be I will never have a chance to come back
since the lab is not opened for students normally...

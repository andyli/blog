The generative arts are going to be shown in [Playful Media][], which is
the showcase of [BScCM][], the Bachelor degree program I graduated last
year. This is going to be my 4th year joining the exhibition([2010][],
[2009][], [2008][])! If you are in Hong Kong and have time, come to have
a look!

It's almost half a year, coding a piece of generative art everyday
using [haXe][] and [openFrameworks][]. It was certainly fun and
educational to me, as I had to keep reading, trying and mixing all those
generating methods, brainstorming new algorithm, looking for best
programming approach etc. Doing all those things everyday sharpen my
skill a lot, and I'm really excited when people [tweet][] [about][]
[them][], leave comment here or over [Flickr][]. Thanks guys!

However, I decided to stop continuing the journey (at least for a
while). Occurring to me often in the last few weeks, I either spent too
much time on one piece, affecting my school works, or because I have to
finish some urgent things, I tweaked only a little on the previous code,
resulted in producing an unsatisfactory piece. I was sick and had a
fever last week, which became a good time to close the project.

I now have more time to play with other interesting ideas, and finishing
the works that queued up. [hxOpenFrameworks][] will continue be
developed, of course. Let's expect some [OpenCV][], Kinect ([OpenNI][])
and other goodness :)

Finally here are the selected pieces I made in June:

Kept the fractal circles idea going.

Some more saturated color with complementary color scheme.

Reduced opacity, the circles merged nicely to each other.

Simplified but surprisely eye-catching vector-style flower.

I ported Eugene Zatepyakin(in-spirit)'s AS3 [FluidSolver][] to haXe and
started to play with it.

Here I put several rotating color sources in the center and push out
dark red colors. Pretty horror looking.

More sources, larger radius. It looks like an eclipse, does it?

An eye-catching fire ring. The key is to add color and force
periodically other than continuously.

Simulating the diffusion of ink on paper.

A cup of generative latte. Think I can build an app for making [coffee
art][].

Another color, another pattern.

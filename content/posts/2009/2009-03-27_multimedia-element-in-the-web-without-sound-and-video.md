Recently JavaScript and CSS is becoming more and more powerful. Like the
experiment shown in [Chrome Experiment][], we can see that the browser
is now really capable to handle all those texts, images andÂ  animations
(at least in the near future, since there is still IE need to catch up).
But yes, multimedia means not only these three but also sound and video.
As I can see there is no really "standard" way to handle that currently.

It is funny that sound and video can only be presented in a web page
with the help of plug-ins. For videos, most of them are served by Flash
Player, like [YouTube][] and [Vimeo][]. And very popular among the
design agencies and artists, mov files are used, which presented by
Quicktime player. Without the plug-ins, no browser can show video. Sound
is most likely embed in Flash and actually not many website make use of
sounds (I'm not talking about those annoying background music okay?).

I don't understand why the browsers/web standards seem to be not
interested to have native support of sound and video. If they care about
those animations, image manipulations, round corners, vector graphics
etc., they should support sound and video too.

Actually I have an idea, seems so crazy but it works - making Flash
player built into the browser. Maybe not using Adobe's Flash Player, if
anybody mind that is not open source, or Adobe crazily disallow to do
so. But there are other open source ones, like [Gnash][] and [swfdec][],
although they may not support all the features but better than nothing.

What do you think?

Recently I need to write a 3D tool to help making a installation
artwork. I know I should use Maya, Processing or anything like that, but
in order to get the least risk, I used my most experienced language,
AS3.

Since I need to render A LOT of stuff (\~400,000 objects), instantly I
faced the performance issue. As you can imagine, even if I could
generate all the objects in 15 seconds, the rendering process must
excess the Flash Player'sÂ  execution time limit.

So I try to make my own async render engine with the help of
[async-threading][]. I extended BasicRenderEngine to
AsyncBasicRenderEngine. The class even has a showBusyCursor property
that let you optionally show the busy cursor on rendering.

But note that this is only a proof-of-concept and actually has little
help of preventing freeze-screen. It is because I only distribute the
individual 3D object's rendering to frames but leaving the sorting,
filtering, post-process code unchanged. Also, the RenderStatistics
returned by renderScene/renderLayers will contain only wrong data until
the RENDER\_DONE event is dispatched.

One last thing, Flash's drawing algorithm seems affecting the async
rendering performance too. So I do not add the viewport to stage.
Instead, once RENDER\_DONE, I draw the viewport on a Bitmap on stage.

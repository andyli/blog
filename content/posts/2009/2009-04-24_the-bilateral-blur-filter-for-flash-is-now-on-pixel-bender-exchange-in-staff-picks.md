I've put my bilateral blur filter on Pixel Bender Exchange and it is
selected as staff picks!

Go and download it from the page: [Bilateral Blur Filter for Flash on
Pixel Bender Exchange][]

ps. That one is optimized, processing time oringinally is 2 - 3s , it's
now 0.6 - 0.7s (for a 320\*240 image).

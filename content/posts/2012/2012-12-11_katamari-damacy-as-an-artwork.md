![Katamari Damacy (塊魂)](/files/2012/CRI_255704.jpeg)

“Katamari” means clump; “Damacy” means soul. It is a game of collecting
objects, creating a large clump of things. Player acts as the Prince,
son of the King of All Cosmos, rolls a katamari that can pick up
anything smaller than its size, forming a large sticky sphere. As more
things get stuck onto the katamari, it grows larger and larger and
eventually able to hold people, houses, islands or even planets.

The story in the Katamari Damacy game series is not an important part of
it, but a “pretext for inspired weirdness”
(<cite title="Colgan, Mike. Review - Me and My Katamari. 18 April 2006. 3 December 2012 &lt;http://www.gamechronicles.com/reviews/psp/meandmy/katamari.htm&gt;.">Colgan</cite>).
Basically it was the King of All Cosmos done something accidentally that
destroyed part of universe, and the Prince was sent to roll up large
clumps of things, in order to for example rebuild the moon, or to fill
up a black hole. However its focus on interaction, the underlying logic
or algorithm, can be seen as the narrative part of the work
(<cite title="Manovich, Lev. &quot;Database and Narrative.&quot; Manovich, Lev. The Language of New Media. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2001. 199-201.">Manovich,
Database and Narrative</cite>).

There is a wide range of objects exist in the game scene, be composed as
a fresh, relaxed, joyful hyperreality. Despite of the destructive act of
rolling katamari around, the atmosphere remains fun and cheerful. It is
made possible by the careful selection of background music (mostly in
Jazz style), cute sound effects and graphics. The game levels are nice
montages of playfulness and positive child memory, for instance
playground, candy shop, theme park, sunny country park with rainbow etc.
The game scenes start cluttered with objects. They are clearly more
packed than their real world counterparts. For example in a bedroom
there are a lot of snakes, books, toys that makes the game world a
celebration of wealth and materials.

Rolling katamari to collect different objects is yet another form of
art, a process of creating the player’s own montage. At the time of
destroying or cleaning up the world, player is creating a piece of work
that can be a new planet in the game world. Its seemly contradictive
destruction and creation is the same as the practice of pastiche and
quotation, “to select elements and styles from the ‘database of
culture’” and “to put them together into new objects”
(<cite title="Manovich, Lev. &quot;The Logic of Selection.&quot; Manovich, Lev. The Language of New Media. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2001. 120-124.">Manovich,

Mentioned by its Japanese creator, Keita Takahashi, at Game Developers
Conference, Katamari Damacy was a comment on consumerism
(<cite title="Welsh, Oli. Katamari was comment on consumerism. 30 March 2009. 3 December 2012 &lt;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/katamari-was-comment-on-consumerism&gt;.">Welsh</cite>).
On one hand, the ultra packed scene suggested the ideals of capitalism.
Cleaning the scene up by rolling the katamari over can be seen as an act
of subvert to “the culture of consumption and even the value of other
video games”
(<cite title="Sino, Cando. Metaphor: Katamari Damacy and Capitalism and Overconsumption. 8 May 2009. 4 December 2012 &lt;http://lasttoblame.blogspot.hk/2009/05/metaphor-katamari-damacy-and-capitalism.html&gt;.">Sino</cite>).
It is because most of the video games nowadays, as a culture interface,
reflected the real world’s favor of capitalism and/or consumerism.
Classical examples are SimCity, Age of Empires, and their inspired
variants, where player starts with a small plain area, develops into a
large place that contains a large amount of artifacts. The “more to
less” direction of Katamari Damacy is the opposite of the mainstream
“less to more” progress. On the other hand, picking up objects by the
katamari is also a metaphor of consuming the materials around us.
Although there is a target size as the goal of each stage, player is
encouraged in the game to roll as much and as large as they can. It is
very similar to the concept of consumerism, that people are encouraged
to purchase goods or service in great amount, often in excess of their
basic needs. Having the theme of consumerism in mind, the delightfulness
made up by the media elements in game seems to be compensation to the
emptiness feeling after mindless consumption. Even Keita Takahashi “felt
empty when the objects were gone"
(<cite title="Welsh, Oli. Katamari was comment on consumerism. 30 March 2009. 3 December 2012 &lt;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/katamari-was-comment-on-consumerism&gt;.">Welsh</cite>).

Katamari Damacy is a good example of a video game being successful in
the consumer market, also being an art piece that contains message and
thoughts from the creator. It was recently acquired as one of the video
games in the permanent design collection of The Museum of Modern Art

**Augmented Mirror** is my latest large-scale project. It is a
development of the technique that uses an one-way mirror
to archive augmented reality. You can read more about it at [its web
site][] (still in development).

Using the technique, a sample installation called **Mind-Body
Interaction** is made. As the title suggests, it is about [Philosophy of
mind][]. It has just been exhibited in [Playful Media][] (SIG Showcase,
Exhibition of [BSc Creative Media][]) and [The SCM Annual][] (graduation
show of [School of Creative Media][]).

Here below is an interview done in Playful Media:

I'm glad that the artwork is mentioned in some of the news on the
exhibitions:

By the way, thanks for my teachers and schoolmates for all the efforts
put in the exhibitions!

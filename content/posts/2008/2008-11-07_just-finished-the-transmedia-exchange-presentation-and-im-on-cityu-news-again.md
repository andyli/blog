In this morning I have just finished the Transmedia Exchange
Presentation with my group-mates. That was just a tiny scale of
presentation, which most of the audiences were BScCM students.

There were reporters from COMO (Communications Office of City University
of Hong Kong) and CM. We presented in this morning and there is article
on CityU home page now... They acted so fast! Below is the link...

Opss, the article title has nothing related to our trip... But Keith's
[Moving Mario][] is really great...

Title: Firefox, you win.

After alternately using IE 7, Safari 3, Firefox 3 and Opera 9.5 for
nearly a month, I can conclude that Firefox 3 is the best browser among
them (at least on Windows and Mac OSX).

Firstly, a good browser should render web pages correctly and Firefox 3
gets 71 marks in [acid3][]. I know, opera 9.5 gets 83 marks, Safari 3
gets 75 marks. But comparing to IE7's 14 marks, I think 71 is
acceptable...

Secondly, Firefox 3 has more functions available. I am not talking only
the build-in functions, but including add-ons. Actually Opera had the
most powerful build-in functions since a long time ago, but it is
lacking add-ons, or I think the add-ons do not act like the way they
should be... they act like separate applications. Also, for every Opera
build-in functions, or nearly any functions you may think of, there
exist a equal (or better) add-on in Firefox. (BTW, [this one][]
rules...)

Thirdly, Firefox is cross-platformed (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux). There is
only a IE 5.2.3 on Mac, seems that there won't be an updated version of
IE for Mac soon. Safari for Windows is still young, most plug-ins for
Safari work only on Mac. Only Opera can run on Windows, Mac OSX, Linux
like Firefox.

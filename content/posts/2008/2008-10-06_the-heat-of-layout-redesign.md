In the past year, web designers/developers seem busy with web layout
redesign. Here were several popular web site that were redesigned to be
named: Yahoo Mail (and [Yahoo's homepage is in progress][]), Xanga,
Facebook, Wordpress (in progress) etc.

It is interesting to me that I really found some of them are using
methods/techniques I learned from class. For example, Wordpress is using
wire-frames ([here][]).

Redesign is a important process which web designer/developer should
handle it carefully. Redesign can make web sites stay competitive and
meeting requirements of continuously updating user profiles/scenarios.
But if the website has already lots of old visitors, redesign may make
them unfamiliar with the web site and cause problems. For instance,
Facebook had token a lot of efforts to make users comfortable with the
new design like its [new design FAQ][], but still, there are drawbacks
brought by the new design like devaluing some type of Facebook app
(blogged by Dare Obasanjo [here][1]).

Actually I am working on redesigning a web site too. But you know,
student's life is always filled with homework and projects. Hope I can
finish it fast and show it to you soon.

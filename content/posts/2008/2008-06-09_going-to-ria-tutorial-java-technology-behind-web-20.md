[Sun Technology Campus Demo - Talk1][]

Today I went to "RIA Tutorial - Java Technology Behind Web 2.0" which is
held by Sun in CityU's Computer Lab. It made me interested when I knew
that JavaFX will be demoed in the tutorial.

JavaFX can be compared with Flex and Silverlight which are technologies
to develop RIAs. Using both declarative and scripting languages.
Everything seemed not too difficult although the syntax is differ from
C++ or ActionScript that I use most. But I think I would continue
concentrating on Flash and Flex (or even try some haxe...) since JavaFX
is still in development and it looks not running fast... fast enough to
run games.

The tutorial gave very simple demos of JavaFX and jMaki. You may find
them from the link on top.

P.S.. I met K and Marco there! I was worrying if I will be the only BScCM
yr1 student who really comes...

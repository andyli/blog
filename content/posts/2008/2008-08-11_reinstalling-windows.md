Title: Reinstalling Windows...

Since my desktop's Windows is quite unstable, especially problematic
with its drivers, I decided to format and reinstall the Windows. It's a
huge pain for me to reinstall that hundreds of software...

With no surprise, there are many problems on the installers of the
software, and the Microsoft's and the Adobe's are the hardest to be
deal with. I think CS3 installers are worth mentioning since nearly 10
hours I used to make them running and they ran at a extremely low speed.
I hope there will be changes in the coming CS4...

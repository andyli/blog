In the last two weeks, from both the lessons of "Web usability design
and engineering" and "Multimodel interface design", I learnt about paper
prototyping. It is a technique that used to test a interface design
before building the interface out. It is widely used in the industry
because it do not cause much and easy to do. If you have no idea what
paper prototype is, here is a video demonstrating it:

I was surprised when I first know what they are... Testing cyber things
in such a old-school way (and still be widely used) is just
unbelievable... It make me think of why there do not exist a better,
more "cyber" way to do this.

We do not directly use computer software to make prototypes just because
the interface of computer has its limitations. With mouse cursor we can
only interact directly with one object in a time while we have two
hands,ten fingers and use to interact with multiple objects
simultaneously.

Maybe the rise of multitouch will solve this problem. Just like we move
the paper in paper prototypes, we can move the virtual papers with our
fingers when multi-touch is used. This is also the point why multitouch is
so welcomed by end-users.

Furthermore, if you are still not satisfied, a 3D presentation of the
virtual paper may help. I am not talking about those [HMD][] things, but
something like [windows flip][]. We can get a specific paper easily
without accidentally selecting other paper on top.

To conclude, it seems it is a fundamental interface problem of
computers. Maybe we should redesign the interface of computer before we
redesign the interface of websites...

Wall-E is a great 3D animation movie. I heard people saying the movie is
so boring, but I really found it meaningful and funny. Maybe people are
expecting a movie for children, which can make them laugh and have fun,
but I think Wall-E is a animation for adults, at least I was watching it
seriously.

The Motorcycle Diaries's Chinese title is 哲古華拉少年日記. The movie is
a long one (over 2 hrs), but it's still too short to tell the whole
story since the story is comprises of many smaller stories of the people
they meet. Maybe I should re-watch this one some day to see if I can
get/feel more.

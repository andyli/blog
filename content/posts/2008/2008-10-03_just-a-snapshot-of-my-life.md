Now I'm setting in CCCU campus in Kowloon Bay. I just ate breakfast with
Ca and she is now attending leature.

Here the enrivroment for working is quite nice: with wind, plants,
seeing the students walking below... Just a little bit annoying is the
wifi, which I need to steal others to use... I have no idea why here is
no CityU wifi for students... And no power too (Although my MacBook
tells me that there are still 4 hours before it sleeps).

Actually I'm tired now since I haven't sleep last night. Yup, I was
working on my simple game design which should be handed in last month...

I am wondering why being a university student there are so many works to
do. Now I am attending six courses, each course has at least one
project. If I add my freelance, part-time jobs/projects together, I
should never relax.

OK, I have just wasted too much time here. Better work hard now.

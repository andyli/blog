It is super busy these days...

I start feeling that my MacBook can't stand for my huge usage anymore. I
have already upgraded it to 3GB RAM, but still I always let it be full
loaded... And my desktop, which has 6GB RAM, does not has CS3, even if
it had, CS3 is still 32-bit, that's no help.

I want to buy a new monitor, 1920x1200+ is preferred; I want to buy a
new MacBook, waiting for Snow Leopard, or another hardware update; I
want to buy a new desktop; maybe it will be Alienware's; I want to buy
CS4 Design Premium... BUT HEY, I HAVE NOOOOO MONEY.

Plz, give me that scholarship...

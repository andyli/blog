I am currently working on a web radio project "Live Show Street" which
is developing by a group of BScCM students. It is basically a virtual
world where people can be web-Js, real-time broadcast to the public. It
is built on Flash.

One of the most challenging part is the bandwidth problem since the
system requires a lot of real-time audio, video transfers. So what I
think of is using a P2P method to distribute the contents. I don't know
if it is supported in Flash but I've heard that there were websites
using P2P to load videos on web pages. And tonight I've just done a
quick search and with surprise P2P will really be supported in the
coming Flash Player 10!

Hope FMS will support it soon.

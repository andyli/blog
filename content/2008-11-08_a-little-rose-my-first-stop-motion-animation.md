Above is my first stop-motion animation made with Keung and Eric. Plenty
of improvement needed... Especially the camera movement, which is shaky.

For those who really want to know what the animation is going on... It's
about a lonely rose in a dark place, met a light object. The rose was
filled with surprise and happiness. But that light went just after it
arrived. So the rose lost its hope and fell.

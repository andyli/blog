The fifth month of doing a piece of generative art everyday using
[haXe][]and [openframeworks][]. As a reminder, all the pieces can be
viewed from my [Flickr set][]. Also the haXe source code for generating
those images can be found in the description in the corresponding Flickr
page. Here below are the selected pieces made in this month:

Drawing only part of the lines generated by midpoint displacement
algorithm can give out some interesting unknown creature contours,
looking into each other's eyes.  
[![20110501\_213017][]][]

Another arrangement. It now looks like an island.  
[![20110502\_215047][]][]

Used a algorithm that I read from somewhere, that start with a point
with some color, for each iteration the color spread to the neighbors
with a little variation. I really love its oil-painting texture.  
[![20110503\_234909][]][]

Increased the spread's random factor, allowing it to spread a little bit
backward.  
[![20110504\_211026][]][]

Keeped changing the spread implementation. This one keep increasing its
hue from the center with a probability of reseting itself (to red).  
[![20110505\_051547][]][]

Made the spread much more unstable and let there be more than one
starting point. Resetting the lightness to 0 periodically gave out
interesting organic layers.  
[![20110508\_003406][]][]

Well, a beautiful rainbow color cup water mark on tablecloth...?  
[![20110509\_233447][]][]

Played with fractal patterns. Full of circles in different sizes and
positions in ratio.  
[![20110515\_050235][]][]  
[![20110516\_031307][]][]  
[![20110517\_003704][]][]

Used only small circles. Pretty cyber-looking.  
[![20110522\_083005][]][]

Used solid-filled circles. Colorful snowflakes.  
[![20110524\_121242][]][]  
[![20110525\_215533][]][]

Simpler smaller patterns.

The fifth month of doing a piece of generative art everyday using
[haXe][]and [openframeworks][]. As a reminder, all the pieces can be
viewed from my [Flickr set][]. Also the haXe source code for generating
those images can be found in the description in the corresponding Flickr
page. Here below are the selected pieces made in this month:

Drawing only part of the lines generated by midpoint displacement
algorithm can give out some interesting unknown creature contours,
looking into each other's eyes.

Another arrangement. It now looks like an island.

Used a algorithm that I read from somewhere, that start with a point
with some color, for each iteration the color spread to the neighbors
with a little variation. I really love its oil-painting texture.

Increased the spread's random factor, allowing it to spread a little bit
backward.

Keeped changing the spread implementation. This one keep increasing its
hue from the center with a probability of reseting itself (to red).

Made the spread much more unstable and let there be more than one
starting point. Resetting the lightness to 0 periodically gave out
interesting organic layers.

Well, a beautiful rainbow color cup water mark on tablecloth...?

Played with fractal patterns. Full of circles in different sizes and
positions in ratio.

Used only small circles. Pretty cyber-looking.

Used solid-filled circles. Colorful snowflakes.

Simpler smaller patterns.

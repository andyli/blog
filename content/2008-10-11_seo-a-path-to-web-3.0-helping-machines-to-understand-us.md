In these few weeks I keep reading articles on search engine optimization
(SEO) and the development of the Internet (mostly Google related, but
Google's is a big part of the Internet right?). More I read SEO, more I
realize the similarities between web 3.0 and the concept of SEO.

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="150" caption="W3C Semantic Web

of web 3.0 is machines will understand our web contents, or let say our
contents will be formated to be understood by machines. Nowadays there
is a technology "[semantic web][]" that introduces similar ideas. The
idea is like improving usability of our web contents, not only to humans
but to machines too. And that is what we are doing for SEO propose: one
of the reasons we use div and css instead of table to build navigation
menus, is to make sure Google understand which is menu and which is
content.

Maybe this will become one more reason why we should learn SEO.

Touchable Holography is a project presented in this year's SIGGRAPH
(2009). The video below say it all.

This gives me a huge impression. How touch feedback can be implemented
is really a topic worth thinking in my FYP. Since my project's
interaction do not give any sensation of touch natively, making ultra
feedbacks for usability is necessary. I have already planned to use both
visual and sound feedback but the result is not surely effective. Using
ultrasound is surely a fantastic way, but it may be expansive. I will
look into it later.

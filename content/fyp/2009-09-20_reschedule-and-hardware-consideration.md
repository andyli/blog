I've just rescheduled a bit on my [FYP Google Calendar][]. The changes
are changing the end day of "4. Built the hardware." to 2009-10-06,
resetting the end day of "3. Hardware/software design." and start day of
"5. Built the software." to next Sunday.

I've bought a pair of PS3 eye for motion tracking. And I've found
[Bumblebee camera from Point Grey Research][] which is satisfying my
needs and can save time for implementation on generating depth map from
stereo images. I've sent email to Point Grey Research but their HK area
representative haven't replied me yet. Hope the cost of it will stay in
my budget. If is is ok, the PS3 eye will be for eye tracking and the
Bumblebee camera will be for 3D pose tracking and reconstruction.

The physical structure of the installation is considered. I think it is
better to have multiple smaller mirror instead of a single big mirror.
It will be easier for transportation and a higher flexibility on the
presentation size. The design would be like that:

That is a large mirror compose of a number of vertical log mirror. Blue
ones are PS3 eye. Yellow one is Bumblebee. Green one is projector. There
will be a better graphic later.

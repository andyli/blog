In the past week I'm looking for physics engine to use in the project.
I've found [PAL][] very promising which abstracted the engine interface
so I can switch to different physics engine later. But later I found
Panda3D, which is a 3D framework with physics engine build-in, it save
even much time for me.

So, I am now using Panda3D inside the OpenFrameworks app.

I have got the reply from the HK representative of Point Grey research,
the price of Bumblebee camera is too high that exceeds my budget.

I will now continue looking for 3D reconstruction algorithm and codes.

In that case, it is likely that I will buy one more PS3 eye. That is a
total of three: two for 3D reconstruction (placed at the sides) and one
for head tracking (placed in the middle).

And the whole set-up placement will follow the structure I found in [NUI
Group Community Forums][].

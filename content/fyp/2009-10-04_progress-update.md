### Hardware

I have been to IKEA to look for suitable frame or wardrobe that will be
used to hold the whole setup.

My criteria is:

-   size (w:75cm h:200cm d:60cm at least),
-   ease of set up and transportation,
-   flexibility (add layers/holes for screw/placement of mirror etc.),
-   cost (HKD1000)

There are 2 possible choices. Both are self-assembled from independent
elements. One is wood and one is metal.

I will go to metal shop to ask for a price quote for a custom made frame
on the coming Tuesday. I will decide and order by Friday.

### Software

I have tried for a few libraries. At the moment the most suitable one
should be [estereo][].

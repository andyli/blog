The story plot has little related to labyrinth, maybe the director want
to symbolize lives as labyrinth?

And I don't really know if the girl really go back to another world or
simply dead at the end... Although many evidence to know the Faun is
real, not the girl's imagination. Anyway, she had been released from
this world.

[Worldwide Haxe 2012][](wwx) has just ended. The long awaited Haxe Java
and C# targets by Cauê Waneck ([@cwaneck][]) were pushed to [the
official Haxe trunk][] (For now you have to build the Haxe compiler from
source in order to use it).

Cauê is kind enough to let me play with it before wwx and I coded two
little [Processing demos][] for him to shown during his talk. The Java
target is very well designed such that using "native" Java class is
extremely easy. It is very similar to [creating externs for Haxe/JS][].
I used a little jQuery script to help me building extern from Javadoc
pages (btw [@Dr_Emann][], [@razaina][] also had similar ideas). Later I
think it would be fun and useful to create a Chrome extension for the
script. Since there is already [a Haxe extern of Chrome extension][], it
is pretty easy to implement it in Haxe.

### Here it is from Chrome store

[Go install Javadoc2Haxe from Chrome store.][]

### How to use

Go to a Javadoc page (eg [Processing's][]). Select a class from the
class menu and you should see a orange icon next to the class name:

![][]

Click on the button, see the magic:

![][1]

Copy and paste the output to your project.

Edit it as you find appropriate, since the generated extern may contain
unwanted methods(maybe referencing another Java type that you don't want
to create extern for it).

You're more than welcome to fill issues, or even fork the extension from
[github][]. Just beware of its quick and dirty code ;)

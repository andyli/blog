[Mirage][]'s extension, re-work of [The Scream][], "Miream" is exhibited
at [Playful Media][] this year (2009).

I get Miream re-constructed in [PhotoSynth][] too!

[Playful Media][] is just over. Our team members were staying in the
exhibition area explaining the art work. We've heard a lot of comments
from visitors, mostly positive, some negative, which are all appreciated
by us since we enjoy communicating with visitors face-to-face.

If you've missed the showcase, and want to know more about Miream, here
I'll try explaining to you.

Official project description
----------------------------

It's a bit long, but really informative:

<cite title="Project description of Miream">
‘Miream” is an excursion of
artistic and technological collaborations crystallized in form of an
installation. The title is an amalgamation of two words: “Mirror” and
“Scream”.

This work is an inventive
attempt to create a magical transformation from 2D image to 3D
installation. The core of the installation is a vertical grid which
holds drips of hanging metal ball chains with different lengths. A
mirror is installed below the hanging metal ball chains. By applying
reversal effect being viewed from the mirror, the result is a
3-dimensional interpretation of the acclaimed painting “The Scream”
(1893) by Norwegians expressionist artist, Edvard Munch. The Hanging
metal ball chains can also generate trembling motions which intensifies
an immersive experience for audience.

The creative process starts
with studying the visual elements of the painting (twilight sky, bridge,
scream head, etc.) and analyzes the image’s composition (curves, depth
and perspectives) in relations to the anguish and fearful emotional
expressions. With aids from precious computation, the painting was
translated into 3D pixels then later replaced with 3mm metal balls.
Lengths and placement of each metal ball chains were preciously
calculated by computer. More than 2000 yards of metal chains were used
to transform an image into this captivating 3D entity.

It is very intuitive and
even meditative for all team members during the process of putting links
and links of metal balls together in order to unveil the
three-dimensional representation of both the visual landscape and inner
emotions of this illustrious painting.</cite>

How did the idea come?
----------------------

Well, actually this is the extension of another installation we made
last year (2008), "**Mirage**". "Mirage" is using the same technique,
hanging up metal chains and using mirror to reflect the 3D structure.
What we created in "Mirage" is a city, so there were basically buildings
formed by the chains.

"Miream" extending "Mirage" in several dimensions: **physical size,
chain intensity, content meaning, technical challenge, budget and team
size**.

Miream's topic is aiming to effectively using the properties of metal
chains. That is, because of its weight, when the chains are hanged up
and grouped together, the overall motion is very elastic and able to
**express a strong emotion** (similar to audience wave). That's the
point why we choose the painting "The Scream". "The Scream" is a famous
piece of expressionism, which is usually **distorting reality for an
emotional effect** (oh ya, you shake the chains to get the emotion for
our case).

What if the visitors are not able to relate it to "The Scream" when they see it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, we're re-creating "The Scream" in a different way, so
**visitors need to know "The Scream"** in order to appreciate it. If the
visitors do not know the original painting, definitely this art work has
no meaning to them. But "The Scream" is so famous that at least most
Hong Kong people know it.

Secondly, we're not cloning "The Scream", we're **expressing the
emotion** in a different way which is even in a higher level. Just like
other kinds of abstract art, focusing on meaning and feeling but not
real-world structure and perspective.

Thirdly, this is the first time we choose this kind of "3D
reconstruction" topic which is very challenging. **We do not have that
large budget** to make a large enough piece to re-create all the details
in the painting. So the resulting picture is quite "low-res" but we
think it is acceptable since our focus is emotion and meaning.

What is the software used?
--------------------------

To create a depth map, we used 3ds Max and PhotoShop with our artistic
sense. For converting the depth map into 3D model and calculating each
length of chain (exporting to a csv file, which can be opened in Excel),
I wrote a program in Flash to do so.

The custom made program can be found [here][]. It is really not
user-friendly and buggy since it was made for ourselves only. But you
can still play with it as long as you are not using for commercial
propose (and I have not removed it yet :P).

If you're a Flash developer, you may noticed that the program is very
similar to the [Alchemy particle pusher][]. In fact, I used [Joa Eberts
AS3 only version][] as a base and altered it as I need to overcome the
limit of int.

How many metal chains are there?
--------------------------------

The resolution is 133x177. So, approximately there are \>20,000 metal
chains.

Where are the photo, video or other documentary?
------------------------------------------------

We are organizing them. There will be a website dedicated for "The
mirage series" (in weeks, hopefully). The url **will be announced in
this blog**. Or you can email me: <andy@onthewings.net>.

The frame is ordered at a metal shop in Mongkok yesterday. It will be
made in aluminum, which I think is better than originally planned as
wood. It is because aluminum is lighter and looks more "hi-tech" which
fit my topic. It will be less expensive if I use iron, but it is too
heavy for transportation.

The frame is ordered that it will be able to set-up and break-down piece
by piece. Each individual parts are set-up with screws. I have asked for
additional holes for me to adjust individual part's height (especially
for the mirrors and projector).

For the mirrors, I will order them after the frame is made.

PS. IKEA's frame and wardrobe are good but the size do not meet my
requirements. And I have asked if it is possible to custom-made, bu it
does not has this service.

Title: 3D engine problem

It has been weeks before my last post. Actually I'm struggling with the
C++ engines.

I'm targeting to use Panda3D with its internal physics engine. However
it is quite hard to dynamically create 3D objects. I complied an example
of creating triangles but it just crashed...

After that, I give a quick try on [irrlicht][] and seems it work. But it
does not have a physics engine, so I looked at using [PAL][] or
[bullet][]. There is an example of integrating irrlicht with PAL in the
PAL's site. But, seems that the example is too old and I cannot compile
it... And I'm still looking at bullet.

It is really frustrating with those C++ 3D engines and I just want the
work done. Now I will spent one or two days see if I can hook up Flash
and OpenFrameworks with socket, if so, I will just use Flash to do the
rendering part... It is slow but at least it works.

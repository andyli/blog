Below are some screenshot of the rendered reconstructed 3D scene. It is
a bit hard to recognize the 3D structure since I'm using a low-res mesh
and no shading.

The large flat plane on the back is the points OpenCV cannot determine
the depth. So the real usable area is the center. Some scaling will be
performed.

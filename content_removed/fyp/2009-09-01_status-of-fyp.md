Since I was traveling in the Europe in the past month and the Internet
connection over there is very unstable. So the research process is now a
bit lag behind the schedule.

Currently work number 1 (Research on related projects) in [WBS][] is
finished and number 2 (Research on possible hardware and software) is on
the go.

I found a number of papers on real-time 3D tracking. Most of them are
from [The ACM Portal][]. I've read a few of them and will organize the
ideas after reading them all.

At the same time, I've found a number of open source libraries that
suitable for my project. I will take some try and blog about them later.

Finally, I will reschedule the works after the FYP Briefing Session (9/9
as stated at [the official course site][]).
